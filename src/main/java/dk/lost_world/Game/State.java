/**
 * Following the rules from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalah
 *
 * 1. At the beginning of the game, four seeds are placed in each house. This is the traditional method.
 *
 * 2. Each player controls the six houses and their seeds on the player's side of the board.
 * The player's score is the number of seeds in the store to their right.
 *
 * 3. Players take turns sowing their seeds. On a turn, the player removes all seeds from one of the houses
 * under their control. Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn,
 * including the player's own store but not their opponent's.
 *
 * 4. If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and the opposite house contains
 * seeds, both the last seed and the opposite seeds are captured and placed into the player's store.
 *
 * 5. If the last sown seed lands in the player's store, the player gets an additional move.
 * There is no limit on the number of moves a player can make in their turn.
 *
 * 6. When one player no longer has any seeds in any of their houses, the game ends.
 * The other player moves all remaining seeds to their store,
 * and the player with the most seeds in their store wins.
